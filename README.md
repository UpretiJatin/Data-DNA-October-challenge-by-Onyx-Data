# Data-DNA-October-challenge-by-Onyx-Data

I'm happy to share a beautiful Spotify dashboard I created using Power BI after following Injae Park's tutorial. This report is based on the Onyx data challenge of October 2023.

He guided us on the following process:-

ðŸŽ¤Enriching Dataset with ChatGPT and Python

ðŸŽ¤Glassmorphism background using PowerPoint

ðŸŽ¤Power BI building

ðŸŽ¤Advanced DAX measures

ðŸŽ¤HTML cover art

ðŸŽ¤Use of DENEB custom visuals

HTML visual and DENEB visuals were very new things for me and faced many problems in doing the same but learning without facing difficulties and issues isn't fun because we don't learn much without that
